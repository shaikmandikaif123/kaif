It looks like users in Lille, Paris are reporting an issue where certain documents, specifically CER and P10, are not being classified correctly in the index within a transaction. The key points from their report are:

1. Inconsistent Classification:

Documents with the same certificate type (CER) are being associated with different IMEX reference numbers, but they are not indexed consistently.

Some transactions have the CER document correctly indexed, while others do not.



2. Missing Entries in the Index:

The CER document is not appearing in the index when expected.

Users are requesting that it be properly added to ensure consistency.




Possible Causes:

Indexing Rules Issue: The system might not be recognizing CER as a valid document type in certain cases.

Metadata Mapping Error: If the indexing relies on metadata, there might be a missing or incorrect mapping for CER documents.

Transaction-Specific Behavior: The classification logic may vary based on IMEX reference numbers, leading to inconsistent results.


Next Steps:

Investigate how documents are indexed and classified within transactions.

Check whether the CER document type is missing in any configuration files or databases.

Review past transactions to identify patterns in when CER is included or missing.

Implement fixes or rules to ensure CER is always indexed properly.

Explanation of the Situation:

1. Voyage record issue:

There's a voyage entry (linked to reference: 000140-01-0637369-POA001) that shows the vessel identifier as "250-22".



2. Lookup result:

When searching for "250-22", it shows the vessel name as:

> "Kota Lambai IMO 9351024 Singapore Formerly known as Yard No.C4250-22 Dalian New (1 Apr 2005 to 1 Apr 2005)"



This implies "250-22" is linked to Kota Lambai, with IMO 9351024.



3. Conflict in voyage data:

According to the voyage record, "Kota Lambai" was shown to be at Argentina on 20 March 2025, but:

The user is unable to verify this â€” possibly due to tracking data showing otherwise.

Therefore, they doubt that Kota Lambai is actually the vessel used for this voyage.




4. External checks failed:

Theyâ€™ve also tried verifying the vessel via external tracking websites.

The results match the internal system (like Digitrade), but still donâ€™t provide a satisfactory confirmation.





---

Conclusion / Main Issue:

The user is unable to confirm the actual vessel used for the voyage marked with vessel number "250-22", because:

The associated vessel name "Kota Lambai" doesnâ€™t match the expected location on the given date (Argentina on 20 March 2025).

External data sources also donâ€™t resolve this mismatch.



---

What they need:

They are asking for clarification or confirmation:

Is "250-22" truly Kota Lambai?

If not, what is the correct vessel name for that number?
