It looks like users in Lille, Paris are reporting an issue where certain documents, specifically CER and P10, are not being classified correctly in the index within a transaction. The key points from their report are:

1. Inconsistent Classification:

Documents with the same certificate type (CER) are being associated with different IMEX reference numbers, but they are not indexed consistently.

Some transactions have the CER document correctly indexed, while others do not.



2. Missing Entries in the Index:

The CER document is not appearing in the index when expected.

Users are requesting that it be properly added to ensure consistency.




Possible Causes:

Indexing Rules Issue: The system might not be recognizing CER as a valid document type in certain cases.

Metadata Mapping Error: If the indexing relies on metadata, there might be a missing or incorrect mapping for CER documents.

Transaction-Specific Behavior: The classification logic may vary based on IMEX reference numbers, leading to inconsistent results.


Next Steps:

Investigate how documents are indexed and classified within transactions.

Check whether the CER document type is missing in any configuration files or databases.

Review past transactions to identify patterns in when CER is included or missing.

Implement fixes or rules to ensure CER is always indexed properly.
